This was one of our top places to visit on our recent trip to Bangkok. We reached it by river ferry and a local shopkeeper even gave us tickets to get in when we bought some drinks from him. The main attraction is the massive reclining golden Buddha and that on its own was well worth visiting. The temple complex is vast and there is so much to see that it can't really be achieved in a single visit, if it is hot and it was. I have an interest in sculptures and artwork so that was what I looked for and there are some impressive small and large sculptures to be seen. Some of the gate guardians are really impressive.Overall one of our top places that we visited that give you an idea of the culture and religion of Thailand.

We loved our visit to the Reclining Buddha, the Temple is serene and so beautiful. We went on a Thursday and it was less busy than the other Temples we visited in Bankok. The size and detail of the Buddha are very impressive. It is a ""can't miss"" temple in Bangkok .

I visited this temple with my family on a private guided tour. We really enjoyed having a guide for ourselves (we where a small group with 4 adults and 2 small kids). Even the kids found it impressive to see this large Buddha.I highly recommend having a guided while visiting here as there is so much history you would otherwise miss.

Needless to say, this is one of the most important sites in Bangkok. It may be helpful to know, however, that this is a complex of many temples and can take quite some time to visit. You may not want to see every single building, so acquaint yourself with the layout and visit those areas that you most wish to see first. If you get tired, you can skip out on the rest as it is so easy to get burnt out seeing temple after temple in Thailand.

It is very nice a lot of buddhas around but as the time goes by it starts to get a little boring so I would not recommend to stay longer than 2 hours.

We had a guide for afternoon and visited the golden Buddha and the reclining Buddha and then went on a small boat trip. It was really enjoyable and educational. The guide we had was very knowledgeable and we could ask lots of questions as his English was faultless.

No big crowd during our visit on the 17th Oct which suited us well as we have 2 young children with us. Interesting . Traffic was quite bad , jam around the temple area when we left at noon.

Incredible not to be missed temple in Bangkok, actually a lot nicer than the palace and cheaper and easier to get into. Highly recommended.

Crowded... victim of its own success... Furthermore never forget that: it's a holy temple !With packing crowd and stifling heat, you must take a lot of time to fulfill your visit... And you have a lot to see (inside, outside, etc.)Otherwise very cheap, around 3 euros for adult only.

So huge is the Reclining Buddha that one feels scared in the first, but when I looked at him the almighty is blessings the mankind.The place is very peaceful, immediately you feel the mind has been purified and the size seems to be indicative of him giving us protection..Truly a touch of divinity...

You would have to walk a bit to cover the whole area. But its worth the walk. Every corner of this temple is worth watching. Do not miss this place if you are in Bangkok and interested in Buddhist temples.

definitely try to to get there as early as possible or later in the afternoon...the crazy tour buses show up and thousands pour our and are pushy and rude. the palace, if you get away from the reclining Buddha is very serene and you almost have it to yourself!!
