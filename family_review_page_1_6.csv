Not everything you see can be captured on a camera. And this place probably tops that. Hey don’t worry, you have your imagination to capture this beautiful pose of the Buddha. The reclining Buddha is so peaceful and the setting serene, so soak in the feeling. Don’t miss out the paintings in front of the Buddha.This temple complex has so many interesting sights including the towering structures scattered around. Another interesting exhibit is the boards set up around the hall of Buddhas. Each board has “When Thais look at Asians” the perception/opinion of other Asians. This makes an interesting visit for youngsters and the adults alike.

I initially thought of visiting 3 - 4 temples in Bangkok, but considering the hot and humid weather, i dropped the idea and to see only This one Wat Pho.. This is a beautiful temple, intricate carvings, gardens adorn this place. it took us about an hour or 2 to complete, especially because me and my husband tried the traditional Thai massage inside the campus of Wat Pho- starts from 250 baht . Also there are several temples inside the campus, if you directly go and see only the reclining Buddha, then you will be done quickly..Overall it was a good experience.

This was one of our top places to visit on our recent trip to Bangkok. We reached it by river ferry and a local shopkeeper even gave us tickets to get in when we bought some drinks from him. The main attraction is the massive reclining golden Buddha and that on its own was well worth visiting. The temple complex is vast and there is so much to see that it can't really be achieved in a single visit, if it is hot and it was. I have an interest in sculptures and artwork so that was what I looked for and there are some impressive small and large sculptures to be seen. Some of the gate guardians are really impressive.Overall one of our top places that we visited that give you an idea of the culture and religion of Thailand.

Needless to say, this is one of the most important sites in Bangkok. It may be helpful to know, however, that this is a complex of many temples and can take quite some time to visit. You may not want to see every single building, so acquaint yourself with the layout and visit those areas that you most wish to see first. If you get tired, you can skip out on the rest as it is so easy to get burnt out seeing temple after temple in Thailand.

Wat Pho in the eye of a spiritual traveler.Beyond the mundane lies the spiritual bliss present within.The Buddha represents to many an enlighten being who has awakened to his true spiritual essence. In the Hindu Vaishnav tradition he is an Avatar of the Divine himself , Krishna ( one of the ten avatars).The reclining Buddha is not resting but rather meditating and resemble to some extend Lord Vishnu who is reclining on the Shesa Naga ( serpent) while countless universes emerges from his naval.This could be a place of worship of you came in that mind set.You may light a candle and offer intense and a lotus bud and offer gold leaves to be placed on small scale Buddhas at the entrance You may also place 108 coins in the 108 bowels behind the Buddha for spiritual purification ( 108 to resemble the 108 chakras on your spine and the 1008 lotus petals on your crown).You may also choose to donate a box set ( filled with the essential monk needs) for a monk (1,000 bhat) and receive a blessing. It could be a day of contemplation and meditation beyond merely a tourist attraction , and then again it is entirely up to you.Enjoy

Lot's of visitors to Bangkok are templed-out. Understandable. I particularly enjoyed Wat Pho. The reclining buddha is unique and impressive. It is enjoyably reachable by water boat (the local ferry is much more economical than the tourist boat and affords the same view and ride). The grounds of the temple are beautiful . Not many explore all of the hidden corners, a walk around is worthwhile. The grounds also host a massage school and I've heard the massages are excellent although unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to sample them myself.

Amazing old temple to visit and its magnificent reclining Buddha really attract people to do selfies which created long queue from the entrance. I think you'd better visit this place in the early morning before crowed.

The statue is impressive but the temple complex is amazing in its own right. Make time to wander and see the standing image and enjoy peaceful courtyards.

There are many Buddha's and temples in Thailand, but this is one that you don't want to miss. The reclining Buddha is impressive not only for its setting in the large temple but for the size and craftsmanship. Standing near the reclining Buddha you are dwarfed by this immense statue. Pictures nor words so this do this justice. Visiting the temples in Thailand you, ladies you will need to cover your legs (no shorts) they do provide sarongs. Don't forget to buy the coins so that you can spread your wishes and prayers that run along the entire wall of the reclining Buddha. The kids were impressed and really enjoyed the visit.

The reclining Buddha is unusual and well worth a stop. The statuary is huge. The most valuable tip I can offer for visiting temples in Bangkok is not to go by car, the traffic can clog bumper to bumper. Rather take a river boat in which you can get on and get off at most of the main attractions.

It is just behind Grand Palace and around 12 minutes walking distance. As we were with children took a tuk tuk with 35 bhat. There are hundred of buddha statues with the one big buddha in a sleeping state. Worth a visit. You can also come 5hrough the river route also. 10 minutes walk from ferry station.

I have to say wow! What a breathtaking monument. It seems separated from the world outside. Situated near the grand palace and has lot to offer. Make sure you spend at least a few hours going through the yard in order to see the whole ground. By the way if you enter through the South Gate you don't have to pay twice.
